## Warnings
- This tester is not enough to validate the project, remember to also test :
	- each program without a 5th argument
	- check the coherence of the output
	- ask for explanations on the choices that were made and the issues encountered
- If you use this tester during this project
```
pgrep philo
```
will output the PID of every running philo process
```
pgrep philo | xargs kill
```
same but will also kill them
